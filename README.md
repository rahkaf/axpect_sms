## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+ (tested with Python 3.13)
- Git
- Virtual environment support

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd axpect_tech
```

2. **Create and activate virtual environment:**
```bash
# Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# Linux/Mac
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Environment Configuration:**
Create a `.env` file in the project root (or rename `.env.example`):
```env
SECRET_KEY="your-secret-key-here"
DATABASE_URL="sqlite:///db.sqlite3"  # For local development
# DATABASE_URL="postgres://USER:PASSWORD@localhost:5432/DB_NAME"  # For PostgreSQL
EMAIL_ADDRESS="your-email@gmail.com"  # Optional: for email notifications
EMAIL_PASSWORD="your-app-password"    # Optional: Gmail app password
```

5. **Database Setup:**
```bash
# Create fresh migrations
python manage.py makemigrations

# Apply migrations
python manage.py migrate
```

6. **Create Test Users (Recommended):**
The system includes pre-configured test users. They will be created automatically on first run.

*Alternatively, create a custom superuser:*
```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

7. **Start Development Server:**
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

8. **Access the Application:**
